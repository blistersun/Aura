    O3: `Ground Level Ozone is formed when pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, industrial boilers, \
    refineries, chemical plants, and other sources react chemically in the presence of sunlight.`,
    CO: `Carbon Monoxide is formed both naturally and through human-driven activities, when fuels containing carbon are burnt in low-oxygen conditions.`,
    SO2: `Sulfu Dioxide is produced from the burning of fossil fuels, specifically coal and oil, \
    and the smelting of mineral ores (such as aluminum, copper, zinc, lead, and iron) that contain sulfur.`,
    CO2: `Though many living things emit carbon dioxide when they breathe, \
    the gas is widely considered to be a pollutant when associated with cars, planes, power plants, \
    and other human activities that involve the burning of fossil fuels such as gasoline and natural gas.`,

    It also can reduce lung function and harm lung tissue.`,
    NO2: `Breathing in raised levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the likelihood of respiratory problems. \
    Nitrogen dioxide inflames the lining of the lungs, and it can reduce immunity to lung infections. This can cause problems such as wheezing, coughing, colds, flu and bronchitis`,
    SO2:`Sulfur dioxide affects the respiratory system - particularly lung function - and can irritate the eyes. Sulfur dioxide irritates the respiratory tract and increases the risk of tract infections. \
    It causes coughing, mucus secretion and aggravates conditions such as asthma and chronic bronchitis.`,
    CO: `Breathing carbon monoxide can cause headache, dizziness, vomiting, and nausea. If levels are high enough, exposed people may become unconscious or die. \
    Exposure to moderate and high levels of carbon monoxide over long periods of time has also been linked with increased risk of heart disease.`,
    CO2: `Exposure to carbon dioxide can produce a variety of health effects. These may include headaches, dizziness, restlessness, a tingling or \
    pins or needles feeling, difficulty breathing, \
    sweating, tiredness, increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, coma, asphyxia, and convulsions`,
